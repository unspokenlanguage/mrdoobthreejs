# `troika-xr`

The `troika-xr` package adds WebXR capabilities to `troika-3d` scenes. These capabilities include:

- UI for launching a WebXR session
- Stereoscopic camera rendering
- 6DoF head tracking
- Controller tracking with pointer raycasting integrated into the main event system
- A few basic helper facades for things like teleportation and menus

> Note: while definitely usable, this package is still somewhat lacking in configurability and features. Requests and contributions are welcome.

For detailed usage information, see the [troika-xr documentation file](../../docs/troika-xr/index.md)
