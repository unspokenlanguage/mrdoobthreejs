/**
 * Convenience class for displaying icons using the Material Icons library. See https://material.io/icons/
 *
 * Use this just like any other UIBlock3DFacade, but set its `icon` property to the name of the icon
 * you wish to display.
 *
 * Note: internally this simply sets the 'text' property, using the Material Icons web font. Since that
 * font utilizes ligatures to alias each icon's full name to its glyph, and Troika's text rendering engine
 * has support for ligatures, this just works without having to deal with obscure character codes.
